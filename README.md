Interactive multi-view dynamic tool for the World Data Visualization Prize 2023 competition "What Just Happened?" concept and dataset.

This visualization shows yearly differences between the years 2010 and 2020. Blue indicates a relative % decrease, while red shows a relative % increase. The application facilitates the analysis of changes in variables as time has progressed.

These graphs are based on data from The World Data Visualization Prize (WDVP) 2023 and the data file used to create this visualization can be accessed [here](https://wdvp.worldgovernmentsummit.org/).

The inspiration for the format is the ["Climate Spiral"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_spiral) visualization designed by climate scientist Ed Hawkins from the National Centre for Atmospheric Science, University of Reading.
